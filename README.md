# MMA Architecture 
Quick start guide:
1. Middleware is a static partial class, use it for Subscribe and publish Actions, Func, Coroutines, Task
2. Modules means Scenes with a federated manager to handle a specification, only exist one active scene
3. Apps means the Entities of a Module scene, these are prefabs, children of the Module GameObject
